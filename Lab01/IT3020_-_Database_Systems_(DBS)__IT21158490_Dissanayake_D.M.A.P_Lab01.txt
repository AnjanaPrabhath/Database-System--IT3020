--- Question 02 --- Creating tables and Inserting Values


--- creating client table

create table client( 
    clno char(3), 
    name varchar(12), 
    address varchar(30) ,
    constraint client_PK PRIMARY KEY(clno)
)
--- inserting values to the client table
    
insert into client values('c01','John Smith','3 east AV, Bentley, WA 6102');
insert into client values('c02','Jill Brody','42 Bent St, Perth, WA 6001');
insert into client values('c03','Bob philiphs','22 pheps, New Bard, Canada');

--- visualizing the client table data

select * from client;



--- creating stock table
create table stock( 
    company char(7), 
    price number(6,2), 
    divident number(4,2), 
    eps number(4,2),
    constraint stock_PK PRIMARY KEY(company)
)

--- inserting values to the stock table

insert into stock values('BHP',10.50, 1.50, 3.20);
insert into stock values('IBM',70.00, 4.25, 10.00);
insert into stock values('INTEL',76.50, 5.00, 12.40);
insert into stock values('FORD',40.00, 2.00, 8.50);
insert into stock values('GM',60.00, 2.50, 9.20);
insert into stock values('INFOSYS',45.00, 3.00, 7.80);

--- visualizing the stock table data

select * from stock;



--- creating trade table
create table trade( 
    company char(7), 
    exchange varchar(12), 
    constraint trade_PK PRIMARY KEY(company,exchange),
    constraint trade_exchange_FK FOREIGN KEY(company) REFERENCES stock 
)

--- inserting values to the trade table

insert into trade values('BHP','Sydney');
insert into trade values('BHP','New York');
insert into trade values('IBM','New York');
insert into trade values('IBM','London');
insert into trade values('IBM','Tokyo');
insert into trade values('INTEL','New York');
insert into trade values('INTEL','London');
insert into trade values('FORD','New York');
insert into trade values('GM','New York');
insert into trade values('INFOSYS','New York');

--- visualizing the stock table data

select * from trade;



--- creating purchase table
create table purchase( 
    clno char(3), 
    company char(7), 
    pdate date, 
    qty number(6), 
    price number(6,2), 
    constraint purchase_PK PRIMARY KEY(clno,company,pdate),
    constraint purchase_FK1 FOREIGN KEY(clno) REFERENCES client,
    constraint purchase_FK2 FOREIGN KEY(company) REFERENCES stock
)


insert into purchase values('c01','BHP', to_date('02/sep/01'), 12.00, 1000);
insert into purchase values('c01','BHP', to_date('08/jun/02'), 10.50, 2000);
insert into purchase values('c01','IBM', to_date('12/feb/00'), 58.00, 500);
insert into purchase values('c01','IBM', to_date('10/apr/01'), 65.00, 1200);
insert into purchase values('c01','INFOSYS', to_date('11/aug/01'), 64.00, 1000);

--- visualizing the purchase table data

select * from purchase;

--- Question 03 

--- 03 (a) 
--- For each client, get the client’s name, and the list of the client’s investments with stock name, current price, last dividend and earnings per share.

select distinct c.name, p.company, s.price, s.divident, s.eps
from client c, purchase p, stock s
where c.clno = p.clno and p.company = s.company;

--- 03 (b) 
--- Get the list of all clients and their share investments, showing the client name, and for each stock held by the client, the name of the stock, total number of shares held, 
--- and the average purchase price paid by the client for the stock. Average price is the total purchase value paid by a client for a given stock (value=qty*price) divided by 
--- the total quantity held by the client.

select c.name, p.company, sum(p.qty) total_qty, sum(p.qty*p.price)/sum(p.qty) APP
from client c, purchase p
where c.clno = p.clno
group by c.name, p.company;

--- 03 (c)
--- For each stock traded in New York, find the quantity held by each client, and its current value (value=qty*price). Display stock (company) name, client name, number 
--- of shares held, and the current value of the shares.

select p.company, c.name, sum(p.qty), sum(p.qty*s.price) current_value
from client c, purchase p, stock s, trade t
where c.clno = p.clno and p.company = s.company and s.company=t.company and t.exchange='New York'
group by p.company, c.name;

--- 03 (d)
--- Find the total purchase value of investments for all clients. Display client name and total purchase value of the client’s portfolio.

select c.name, sum(p.qty*p.price) total_pprice
from client c, purchase p
where c.clno = p.clno
group by c.name;

--- 03 (e)
--- For each client, list the book profit (or loss) on the total share investment. Book profit is the total value of all stocks based on the current prices less the total amount paid 
--- for purchasing them. 

select c.name, sum(p.qty*(s.price-p.price)) book_profit
from client c, purchase p, stock s
where c.clno = p.clno and p.company = s.company
group by c.name;
